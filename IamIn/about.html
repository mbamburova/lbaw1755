        <h2>About this awesome website</h2>
        <p></p>
        <p>As our lives tend to be more and more busy, it brings the need of properly schedule our events in an organised way.
            So, it would be very helpful to have a platform that could store and present events in an interactive and user-friendly way,
            so that their users could manage and better plan future events that they want to share with other friends.
            We thought of developing this, also to give the possibility for users to search for forthcoming public events nearby to attend.</p>
