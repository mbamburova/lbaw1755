## LBAW55 Event Management System

### Description
The main goal is to specify, develop and promote an event management system available through the web for all users who are interested in creating, managing and sharing upcoming events with other users.

The system should have event creation as its main feature. An event has to be created by a user signed in to the system which means a login system is necessary. Once a user is assigned to an event, he can invite other users which may accept, ignore or reject the invitation. Filter capabilities should be implemented so the user can separate past, current and future events as well as events that he was invited to, rejected or plans to go. A search feature is also needed so users can find a public event that they might want to attend more easily. The system should also take advantage of the Google Maps API so an event’s location can be easily established.
