                    <p align="center">It is super-easy! You only need to go to PUBLIC EVENTS section where you will see all public events. You can search in them using various parameters
                       or share them - just press SHARE EVENT button and send a link to your friends.
                    </p>
                    <p align="center">For creating your own events and inviting your friends to the events you have to be registered. The registration is completely free!
                        After registration you can change your profile picture and other information.
                        Next thing what registration offers you is your own MY EVENTS section, where you can manage your created events, events which you are invited to or ignored events.
                        Of course, searching is possible as well!
